## Personal Comments:

This one took me longer than it probably should have since I was working on a team project as well, and taking my work lunch at later hours (when I study). Having to switch between exercises provided me excellent practice having to quickly familiarize myself with prior edits. Also learned about the handiness of using a stying framework and got more IIFE repetitions.
